<h3><font color="#DD0000">Instructions</font></h3>

<p>This program helps you improving your typing skills by playing
a simple game: characters are falling down the screen; you have
to stop them before they reach the ground by pressing the
corresponding key on the keyboard.</p>

<p>You can use the the lesson plan window do select which keys
you want to practice with (NB: changing the keys in the lesson
plan changes the keyset of the next game, not the one, if any,
who's already in progress).</p>

<p>At the end of each &quot;game&quot; you can look at the
Performance evaluation window to see how well you have done, and
to receive advice on what to do next.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><font color="#FF0000">History</font></h3>

<p>In 1991 a program with the same name (later changed to
&quot;Typing Arcade&quot;) was written by Jim Patterson and
released as freeware for the NeXT platform. I found it extremely
useful, and I used it ever since to improve my typing skills.
After I abandoned the NeXTSTEP platform for good a year ago, I
started missing this little utility. Hence why I thought about
writing a version in Pure Java: this way, I will always be able
to run it, no matter what future platforms I'll have to migrate
to!</p>

<p>I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do. <a
